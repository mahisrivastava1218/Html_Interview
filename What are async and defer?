Purpose of async and defer
Both are used to load external JavaScript files without blocking the parsing of HTML.

async
Downloads the script in parallel with HTML parsing.
Executes the script immediately after it's downloaded, pausing HTML parsing.
Example:
<script src="script.js" async></script>
Behavior:
HTML starts parsing.
script.js is fetched asynchronously.
As soon as it's ready, it runs immediately.
HTML parsing pauses while it runs.

âœ… defer
Downloads the script in parallel with HTML parsing.
Waits until HTML is fully parsed, then runs scripts in order.
Example:
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
Behavior:
HTML starts parsing.
script.js is fetched asynchronously.
After the entire HTML is parsed, script executes.
Maintains execution order for multiple scripts.
