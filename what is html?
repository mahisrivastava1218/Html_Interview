HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.


It is, like the name suggests, a set of rules for querying the web.
It works on a client-server model, where the client, in most cases, the browser, makes a network request, and waits for the server to respond.



Browsers use HTTP requests to fetch us web pages.


When we enter a website URL, the browser creates an HTTP request for the HTML of the page, on our behalf, and sends it to the server on which the website is hosted.
The HTTP response from the server is read by the browser and rendered for us beautifully as web pages instead of the raw HTML returned.
