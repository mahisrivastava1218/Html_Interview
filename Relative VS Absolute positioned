ðŸ”¹ position: relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
can use top, left, right, bottom to move it.
It reserves space in the layout.
Use case: To slightly move an element while keeping its space.
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;  /* moves 10px down */
}
ðŸ”¹position: absolute
The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (anything with relative, absolute, or fixed).
If no ancestor is positioned, itâ€™s relative to <body> (the document).
It does NOT reserve space.
Use case: Used to freely place an element anywhere in a container.
.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}
 To make absolute work inside a container, that container must have position: relative.
