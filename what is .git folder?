The .git folder is the hidden folder that stores all the version history and configuration for a Git repository.
| Content    | Purpose                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HEAD`     | Points to the current branch                           |
| `config`   | Repository-specific settings (user, remote URLs, etc.) |
| `refs/`    | Contains branches and tags                             |
| `objects/` | Stores all commits, files, and history (as hashes)     |
| `logs/`    | Keeps a log of all Git actions                         |
| `index`    | Tracks what's staged (for the next commit)             |

üîç Why It Matters:
Without .git, your folder is not a Git repo.

If you delete it, you lose all version history.

You can‚Äôt run commands like git status, git log, or git commit without it.

üß† Example:
When we run:
git init
Git creates the .git folder to start tracking changes.
