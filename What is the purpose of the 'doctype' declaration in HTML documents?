The purpose of the <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML documents is to tell the browser which version of HTML the page is written in, so it can render the page correctly.

<!DOCTYPE> must be the very first line in an HTML document.

It is not an HTML tag, but an instruction to the browser.

It helps the browser operate in "standards mode" instead of "quirks mode", ensuring consistent rendering.

Common Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
This declares an HTML5 document.

Why It's Important:
Without a proper <!DOCTYPE>, browsers may switch to quirks mode, which tries to mimic old, non-standard behaviorâ€”often leading to inconsistent layout and CSS rendering across browsers.
