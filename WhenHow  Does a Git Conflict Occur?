A Git conflict happens when Git can't automatically merge changes between branches ‚Äî usually because two people changed the same part of the same file.

Situations That Cause Conflicts:
Scenario	What Happens
Merge (git merge)	Two branches change the same line
Rebase (git rebase)	Your commits conflict with the latest changes
Pull (git pull)	Remote and local changes clash
Cherry-pick	Picking a commit that modifies lines already changed

üß† Example:
You and your teammate both edit the same line in app.js

You both commit changes

You try to git pull or git merge their branch

Git can't decide which version to keep ‚Üí conflict!

‚ö†Ô∏è How You Know:
Git shows
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in app.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and commit the result.
The file will contain:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
‚úÖ How to Resolve:
Open the conflicted file
Edit it manually and choose what to keep

Run:

git add filename
git commit
